# FS22_ExampleCropCalendar

Adding a custom crop calendar can be done in a few steps:
1. Download this repository.
2. Unzip and move the directory to your mod folder.
3. Edit growth.xml to match your wishes.

If you are creating multiple custom calendars, make sure to rename the title in the modDesc.xml, most importantly rename `<map id="ExampleCropCalendar"` to be unique or it may not be recognized.
